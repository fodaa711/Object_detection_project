YOLOv8 Object Detection for Self-Driving Cars
A comprehensive implementation of YOLOv8 object detection for autonomous vehicle applications, providing real-time detection of vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and other road elements.

Overview
This project implements the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection model for self-driving car applications. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that processes images in a single pass, making it ideal for autonomous vehicle perception systems where speed and accuracy are critical.

The implementation includes:

Pre-trained YOLOv8 model integration
Image and video processing pipeline
Real-time object detection and visualization
Support for multiple object classes relevant to driving scenarios
Performance metrics and evaluation tools
Web-based user interface for interactive detection
Features
Real-time Detection: Process images and video streams with minimal latency
Multi-class Detection: Identify and classify vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, traffic signs, and more
Bounding Box Visualization: Clear visual representation of detected objects with confidence scores
Customizable Confidence Thresholds: Adjust detection sensitivity based on application needs
Performance Metrics: Evaluate detection accuracy and processing speed
Web Interface: User-friendly UI for uploading images and viewing detection results

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object_detection_project.git
cd object_detection_project
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the YOLOv8 model weights:

# The weights will be downloaded automatically when running the model for the first time
# Or you can manually download from https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8m.pt
Usage
Command Line Interface
Run object detection on a single image:

python scripts/detect.py --source path/to/image.jpg --output path/to/output
Run object detection on a video:

python scripts/detect.py --source path/to/video.mp4 --output path/to/output
Web Interface
Start the web application:

python app.py
Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the web interface.

The web interface allows you to:

Upload images for object detection
Adjust confidence thresholds
View detection results with bounding boxes and labels
Download processed images with detections

Model Details
This project uses YOLOv8m, a medium-sized variant of the YOLOv8 architecture, which offers a good balance between speed and accuracy. The model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset, which includes 80 different object classes.

Key features of YOLOv8:

Single-stage object detection
Anchor-free detection
Advanced backbone network
Multi-scale feature fusion
Optimized for real-time performance
Examples
Detection Example

The model can detect various objects relevant to driving scenarios:

Vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles)
Pedestrians
Cyclists
Traffic lights
Traffic signs
Road elements
Performance
YOLOv8m offers the following performance metrics:

Inference speed: ~35 FPS on GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3080)
mAP (mean Average Precision): 50.2% on COCO val2017
Size: 49.7 MB
Web Interface
The web interface provides an intuitive way to interact with the object detection system:

Upload: Drag and drop or select images for detection
Configure: Adjust confidence threshold and other parameters
Detect: Process the image and view results
Explore: Interact with detection results
Download: Save processed images with detection annotations
